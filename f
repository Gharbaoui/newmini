Simpletext started as a passion project because I couldn’t find what I was looking for. 
Most apps were trying to do too much and ended up bloated with features I don’t need. 
So I built Simpletext based on a simple premise — what if there’s an app that refuses to do more, 
choosing instead to do just one thing, and do it well? For Simpletext, that one thing is writing.
